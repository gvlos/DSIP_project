<b>Abstract</b>

Kalman filter, Kalman smoothing and Extended Kalman filter algorithms are
briefly presented. An application of Kalman filtering and smoothing procedures
is proposed to estimate the trajectories of tennis ball. In the provided IPtython
notebook the Kalman filter implementation has been revisited with respect to the
version proposed during lab activities, while the Kalman smoothing algorithm
has been implemented from scratch. Real data coming from a private tennis
club instrumented with a 3D stereoscopic system were used. Given an extremely
simple physics linear model and sufficient accuracy of measurements, the Kalman
smoothing solution was shown to be a trivial yet effective strategy to deal with
relatively small temporal holes due to missing frames.
